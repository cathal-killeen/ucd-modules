201700,ARCT,40970,Arch Plan and Env Policy,Irish Timber & Sustainability,Irish Timber & Sustainability,5,SEM_2,"The research interests underlying this course relate to the current imperative of establishing more sustainable building practices within Ireland and the current interest in timber construction to achieve this goal. There are inherent contradictions in the use of wood as a sustainable building resource in Ireland as the quantity, quality and diversity of timbers available locally is limited thus leading to the importation of material, which carries significant embodied energy costs. A better scenario would be to develop a means to use the local timber more effectively in construction, as well as to consider the species currently under cultivation. There are a number of ways to use small timber sizes more effectively in construction, including the bent wood technologies or engineered timbers that can optimize the strength of timber. The course will investigate and experiment with alternative technologies to advance a collective knowledge base and establish a more sustainable practice of timber use within the architectural profession in Ireland.

The course operates on the premise that architects are responsible to operate in a sustainable manner within their profession and much of their influence resides in their understanding and use of local construction materials. This course aims therefore to look at timber resources available within the local context in specific terms from how Ireland�s tree cover has changed over the centuries, examining some of the ecological, social and economic causes and effects of these changes, to more specific issues such as the appearance and workability of several types of timber, both hardwoods and softwoods. This material will serve as a foundation for individual research and will inform the 1:1 collective design/build investigation to be undertaken by the class.

Objectives1. To establish a coherent body of information for reference regarding all aspects of local timber management and use within the Irish construction industry.2. To collate and establish a reference guide on local Irish timbers and a database of investigative and/or innovative uses of timber in architecture, which could inform local practice. This material, which will be submitted by students as a research project, will form part of the end of year exhibition.3. To establish an annual design build project which will allow for investigation of timber properties at the scale of 1:1 through innovative or investigative building projects using local timbers.","On completion of the module, students should be able to 1. Identify specific consequences of material choices and potentials within design 2. Understand meaning and value of construction materials within the framework of the sustainability mandate 3.

Some environmental risks, further exacerbated by the location, layout and design of our built environments, are likely to become more frequent and damaging in the face of climate change.  Therefore two principal challenges facing policymakers as they strive to promote a more sustainable future are concerned with: understanding people's perceptions of, and interaction with, the environment so as to motivate preferable environmental behaviours and mitigation actions; and, promoting the design of more resilient built environments, in both urban and rural areas.  To explore these types of challenges, this module will embed case study examples from the instructors own research throughout.  These case studies will illustrate the need for policy makers to manage environmental risks facing built environments by pursuing a mix of policies that will deliver 'places' that are better able to cope with environmental stresses.

Accordingly this module may be divided into a number of constituent parts:
�	Firstly, this module will introduce you to various environmental challenges facing built environments; 
�	Secondly, this module will define key concepts and terminology associated with risk management such as risk and hazard, perception and vulnerability, adaptation and resilience;
�	Thirdly, this module will examine, and case study in more depth, the challenges associated with various water-resource management issues in built environments (e.g. flooding, urban water supply, rural wastewater disposal etc.);
�	Finally, consideration will be given to the types of policy approaches most appropriate to achieve more resilient built environments.
","On successful completion of the course, you should be able to: 
�	Demonstrate an understanding of some key environmental risks facing communities today and likely to emerge in the future;

In this module, you will learn all about the challenges of interpreting and communicating archaeological knowledge of the past to the public in the present because these are a key part of archaeological practice. 

Archaeology has been described as an unsusual academic discipline in that a lot of archaeological research and indeed its controversies are carried out in the gaze of the public. In Ireland and many other countries the majority of archaeological work is in one way or another funded by the public purse, placing a responsbility on archaeologists to communicate their research effectively. As documented in the reaction to museum exhibitions the material remains of past societies are in themselves inherently interesting  to people. This connection can be heightened by the character of the evidence, for example human remains, and the sense of ownership that communities share with the past. The concept of community archaeology has come to describe the process of active engagement with and of local communities in archaeological research and educational activities including public outreach. There are frameworks such ICCROM�s Living Heritage Approach which are aimed at guiding the way in which archaeologists and other heritage practitioners should value and engage with the view and knowledge possessed by local communities.

In the Republic of Ireland since 2007 there has been a specific  government strategy to  review and increase the number of World Heritage Sites. This led to the evaluation by an expert group of the existing Tentative List and public consultation regarding a new draft Tentative List of potential sites for nomination which was submitted to and accepted by UNESCO in 2010. There are several interesting aspects to the new Tentative List, not least the inclusion of serial or multi-site nominations. In 2013 the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht announced an important change in approach to potential nominations from the Tentative List, stating that only proposals that were developed from 'the bottom up' would be considered.

Not only do we have to produce more food in a sustainable way, with low inputs and minimal environmental impacts, but we also have to ensure that the food is nutritious, safe and affordable. This challenge is particularly daunting as there is already evidence of declining or stagnating crop yields and, because of increased diversification of agricultural production systems, increased competition between food production and the production of bioenergy and other biomaterials.

This module will examine the threats to agricultural production caused by climate change, agricultural diversification and environmental/legislative constraints. It will also examine how increased photosynthetic productivity might be achieved, as well as the potential for producing crops that are more resistant to combined abiotic /biotic factors. We will also examine how the dual objectives of enhancing food production whilst increasing the diversity of agricultural products, may be met, including the introduction of new/novel crops and the utilization of wild plant genetic resources and land races. Finally, whilst climate change is almost always thought to have negative consequences we will also examine how some aspects of our future climate might be used to our advantage for enhancing crop yields.","1. Provide an evaluation of the constraints on future food production;
2. Describe the main features of climate change and how they may impact on crops;
3. Evaluate the ways in which crops/plants might be modified to enhance productivity and yield;
4. Recognise the importance of enhancing combined abiotic/biotic stress for realising potential yield increases under field situations;
5. Evaluate the environmental impact of crop production systems and the concept of sustainability;
6. Evaluate how some aspects of climate change, particularly elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, may be used to our advantage;
7. Evaluate how management interventions interact with climate change.

201700,BOTN,40190,Biology and Environmental Sci,Plants and Stress,Plants and Stress,5,SEM_2,"Plants, as animals, experience stress during their life time.  Whereas the term 'stress' has mainly psychological implications for e.g. humans, 'stress' in plants refers more to the very basic needs of survival - having enough water, nutrients or energy.  Plants experience a range of stresses, which can be classified into biotic stresses (such as grazing) or abiotic stresses (such as drought).  In this module, we will be focussing on abiotic stresses, in particular drought, salinity, mineral nutrient limitation and heavy metals.  Strategies that plants have evolved to cope with these stresses, be it either through 'facing' the stress or evading it, will be reviewed.  The approach to this topic will be from the physiological point of view, with examples of underlying molecular mechanisms.","On completion of this module students should be able to:
- Develop a general understanding of the basic needs of plants and of the strategies that plants use to meet these needs even under adverse environmental conditions (stress);
- Understand stress concepts - the definition and origin of the term 'stress', general and specific responses to stress and basic similarities and differences in the response to stress between plants and animals (e.g. humans);
- Obtain in-depth understanding of responses of plants to the stresses drought, salinity, mineral nutrition and heavy metals;
- Understand the different strategies that plants use to cope with stress and to integrate responses at various organisational levels (e.g. plant, plant organ, tissue, cell); 
- Also, advanced oral and group presentation skills.
Criteria for 4th-year level: In-depth understanding of complex responses; providing a synthesis of knowledge of basic processes of plants to understand their performance in a potentially stressful environment; view current stress concepts and plant responses critically.

These decades have seen an explosion in the development of blockbuster drugs developed to treat a widening range of complex diseases and have witnessed the rapid maturation of the science of development of engineered proteins.  Biotherapeutics have significant advantages over small molecule therapies since they have been shown to be even more effective due to their ability to target specific molecules within the human body. However, unlike most conventional small molecules like aspirin and antibiotics, the development, manufacturing and storage of biotherapeutics is more complex and require sophisticated production and control processes. In contrast with small molecule therapeutics, biotherapeutics depend upon the host cells of living organisms to effectively produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Throughout this module, analytical techniques such as decision trees, utility functions, multi-criteria decision making and simulation modelling and analysis would be covered to provide the business decision-makers and decision analysts with an approach and set of tools to construct and analyse a model of a decision problem involving single or multiple objectives. An important objective of this module is to integrate the quantitative and psychological aspects of decision making; apart from the mathematical contents of making a decision, the behavioural issues which are associated with the implementation of decision analytics are also addressed. 
In many problems, the decision maker is not sure what will happen if a particular course of action is chosen; this requires a decision maker to make a decision under uncertainty which would be a subject of an important topic within this module. Therefore, it is expected that students are familiar with basic statistical concepts, probability distributions and regression.

Examples of the former are lifestyle, franchise and family entrepreneurs; and the latter are often referred to as ambitious, high potential, creative, extreme or professional entrepreneurs or creative disrupters and innovators; and intrapreneurs, or corporate entrepreneurs. 
The presence of the latter is more important for achieving economic growth and value creation than entrepreneurship in general. Thus, ambitious entrepreneurs are actively sought and financially supported by firms, agencies and banks. However, managing the high value start-ups of ambitious entrepreneurs creates particular difficulties for them; and they now seek entrepreneurially-oriented staff to manage the start-ups. 
This course has been designed to appeal to those: 
(1)	Wishing to understand entrepreneurship to launch or accelerate careers in institutions or
(2)	Considering establishing an innovative opportunity in an ambitious start-up.
The course aims to understand entrepreneurship and extend it to the financial management of entrepreneurial start-ups. It is not intended that the course will be a financial management course; rather that it will discuss aspects of finance specific to ambitious start-ups to a deeper degree than typical entrepreneurship courses. 
The course is highly interactive and practical; and students are encouraged to indicate relevant areas, which they would like to explore. In particular, students will be able to indicate the extent of finance that they wish to study.
The course has been structured as follows:
(1)	Lectures focus on the entrepreneurial process of taking an idea to market;
(2)	One case study is used through the course to explore aspects of entrepreneurship; 
(3)	An entrepreneurial Business Plan, with particular emphasis on financial aspects, is built during the course as an assignment.

While this development is unprecedented and business dislikes uncertainty it is a lively and interesting time to study the EU. Manufacturing and service companies across a wide range of industries, established in and trading across the EU must engage with the EU's policies and legislative requirements. The European Union's governance processes and measures, are negotiated by EU institutions and member state governments. To varying degrees across policy sectors - companies, industries, non-government organizations, and consumer interests are 'stakeholders' in these policy processes. It is the institutions of EU governance, which mediate among these stakeholders. 
    The UK's preparations for Brexit, the investigations into Google, Apple, Starbucks and McDonalds under EU competition policy; consultations with The Alliance for Energy Intensive Industry, BusinessEurope and other business stakeholders on the reform of the European Emissions Trading Scheme to decarbonise energy; measures to address the availabliity of capital for Small and Medium Enterprises and investment through a Capital Markets Union; all represent recent examples of the EU's 'non-market' business environment. These examples illustrate how the EU has the potential to influence a company's structures and strategies along with their markets, hence the module's title 'The European Union in Business'. Detailed knowledge of the ongoing development of the EU's policies and policy processes is necessary for a company's management to design structures and strategies to first, respond to the EU's influence and second, adopt a proactive engagement with EU governance and the 'non-market' business environment.

According to the World Health Organisation, it is stress emanating from the workplace that affects the psychological and physical health of individuals, as well as the effectiveness of organizations and the functioning of society.

Considering this, it becomes clear that it is essential to focus on wellbeing in the workplace. This module will emphasise the individual�s wellbeing as a starting point for organisational and societal wellbeing using approaches such as mindfulness and compassion. 

Mindfulness can be seen as a means to build resilience to the adverse effects of stress, to find another way to manage difficulties and to find a way to respond differently to the challenges that are experienced in everyday life. Compassion, and in particular self-compassion, is key to success in this change in habit and most importantly, it is a skill that can be learned. 

The module will be both academic and practical in content and will require students to commit to a regular and consistent engagement with practices and techniques to develop their mindfulness and compassion skills throughout the semester which are captured in discussions and reflective journals.

It is advised that students are comfortable with their emotional wellbeing before enrolling in this module. In the event of questions about the suitablity of this module, please contact the module coordinator prior to enrolling in the module.

Overcoming these scale-up obstacles is strongly dependent upon understanding the interrelationship between physiological determinants of cell growth and product synthesis and also the physical determinants of culture performance in the intensified bioreactor environment. A mathematical model is a systematic attempt to translate the conceptual understanding of a real-world system into mathematical terms. Successful model development relies on the integration of physical mechanisms (e.g. mass transfer and hydrodynamics) with the investigation of the biological response to conditions expected in the bioreactor environment. If the conceptual model is good, the model should reproduce the relevant phenomena and can be used for a number of purposes; to test hypotheses, to identify bottlenecks in a process; to aid the interpretation of experimental data or to examine processes where experiments are impractical at an early stage in the development of the process.

201700,GEOL,30010,Earth Sciences,Applied Palaeontology,Applied Palaeontology,5,SEM_2,"This module introduces you to two sets of palaeobiological data that are widely used in Applied Earth Sciences: ichnofabrics and trace fossils; microfossils.

The first explores how the structures produced by organisms as they process sediment (bioturbation) are related to key variables such as depositional context, the organism�s ecology and physiology, plus environmental conditions (including degree of oxygenation and sediment consistency).  Use of trace fossils and ichnofabrics as a tool in basin analysis reflects their being routinely sampled in core (probably more so than macrofossils), and thus especially relevant to contexts where outcrop data is not available (e.g. offshore petroleum basins). Trace fossils and ichnofabrics are an alternative, complementary, record to body fossil data when studying key events in Earth�s history. This aspect is explored using the major changes in marine ecosystems that occurred in response to the evolution and diversification of animals during the late Neoproterozoic-early Phanerozoic interval.

In the second part of the module the biology, ecology and geological history of the principal fossil groups that are routinely preserved as microfossils is considered.  The key concepts of the sub-discipline of biostratigraphy (the use of fossils for the relative dating of rocks) are introduced and the roles of different microfossil groups reviewed.  Emphasis is placed on how this is applied in constructing chronostratigraphic frameworks for depositional systems. The importance of microfossils as a record of environmental change in the most recent part of earth�s history (the Anthropocene) in response to human activities is explored. This includes the use of microfossils (and macrofossils) as tools in conservation palaeobiology to define baseline conditions against which the extent of subsequent environmental modification can be assessed. This is a key component of determining the environmental impact of maintaining ecosystem services.   
","At the end of this module students will be have an understanding:

of the basis on which trace fossils are named, and the principal ethologies (behaviour patterns) they represent 

of how trace fossils are diagnostic of environmental parameters such as salinity, oxygenation, sediment consistency and water depth

that the recurrent association of ichnotaxa (ichnofacies) are characteristic of specific depositional settings, and the use of this in basin analysis

of the practical applications of trace fossils in basin analysis, including the appearance of key ichnogenera in field contexts, as well as in randomly oriented sections typical of core

of the processes involved in the creation of ichnofabrics, including identifying components generated by overprinting of successive tiers within a community and the emplacement of successive communities 
that the, as yet not fully understood, evolutionary palaeoecology of the Ediacaran/Cambrian boundary interval is documented by ichnofabrics produced by epifauna and infauna

of the geological record, and principal applications, of the key groups of microfossil

The topics of the course divide into three chronological and logical sections. The first examines the preconditions of European economic development, paying particular attention to the demographic, technological and institutional changes that supported growth. The second section focuses on the Industrial Revolution in England asking what exactly it was, how it can be measured, and who benefited? The third examines the shift to modern economic growth in other European economies, including (eventually) Ireland.  This course also enables us to explore the question 'why are some so rich and some so poor?' and provides a basis for your understanding of both the Irish economic growth and that occurring in other parts of the world.","This is a course in applied economics.  To that end, topics have been chosen to illustrate how evidence and theory are combined to further our understanding of particular historical events.  The economist, by his or her training, tends to become expert in the construction and manipulation of theories and hypotheses.  The historian tends to become expert on sources, evidence, and their reliability.  A satisfactory social science should combine both of these aspects. Economic history presents a great opportunity to observe the use of economics as a mode of explanation across a wide range of questions and issues.The examination of these themes will combine the historical literature with the theoretical constructs of economics.

201700,EDUC,50070,Education,Critical Discourse Analysis,Critical Discourse Analysis,5,SEM_2,"Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is a way of carrying out social research with a focus on �discourse� i.e. on text and other forms of semiosis analysed in their contexts of use, production and reception. However, while becoming increasingly popular across the variety of social and political sciences, many features of what CDA is or does remain misinterpreted. For example, CDA is often approached from a limited perspective i.e. as a �method� rather than a coherent approach with a distinct theory and methodology. Though resting on sound theoretical and methodological foundations, CDA is also often viewed as a homogeneous approach with criticism against CDA failing to notify that it is indeed a research tradition which consists of several schools which, while sharing general principles on e.g. the relation between language and power, ideology, differ in their theoretical and methodological ontology as well as their analytical pathways and foci.
This module offers an introduction to Critical Discourse Analysis as an approach to research on dynamics of contemporary political and institutional change, it considers key theoretical foundations, methodological premises and analytical pathways in CDA. In doing so, and by clarifying several misconceptions and misinterpretations of CDA that are widespread in social- and political-scientific research, the module will highlight those aspects of critical-analytic studies which make them particularly useful to interdisciplinary and context-related explorations of contemporary politics. By drawing-out similarities and differences between CDA � and especially one of its major traditions known as the Discourse-Historical Approach (or DHA) � and other discourse-based approaches widely-used in social and political studies (e.g. the Discourse Theory initiated by Laclau and Mouffe), the module will highlight such advantages of CDA/DHA research as, inter alia, systematic approach to analysis or its clear relation to the levels of pre-analytical theorising and post-analytical interpretation.
","The aims of this module are to:
1. Introduce participants to different theoretical approaches to the analysis of discourse;
2. Develop participants understanding of the structure of a range of text and other forms of semiosis analysed in their contexts of use, production and reception;
3. Develop participants skills in analysing the discursive structure of texts / semiosis; and 
4. To assist participants to identify meaningful applications of discourse analysis in research settings.

-  demonstrate knowledge and understanding of a selection of contemporary theoretical approaches to discourse analysis;
-  compare and evaluate differing theoretical and analytic approaches to discourse;
-  relate a strong theoretical understanding of various discourse genres to practical proposals for research projects;
-  identify and use effectively academic and professional resources, printed and electronic, relating to discourse analysis; and

The module will be practical in nature. Students will work (in teams) with a local primary school to apply and reflect on ideas introduced in College. 

The entire module revolves around our partner primary schools visiting UCD�s Outreach Lab to carry out a scientific investigation of their own design. UCD undergraduate science education students will work with the primary students and their teachers to carry out this work. This module relies on a co-teaching model where students and staff from UCD will work with participating schools before and after the visit to UCD.","The primary learning intention of this module is for students to co-teach a science project in a local primary school.

201700,EDUC,10150,Education,Critical Education,Critical Education,5,SEM_2,"The aim of this course is to enable you to think critically and innovatively about education.  As students and teachers we will work together exploring the ways in which education can emancipate us and others to use our knowledge and understanding to promote a socially just world. 
Education is increasingly defined as a tool of the capitalist economy. It has become so preoccupied with preparing people for the market, that measurement, assessment, grading and ranking, both of people and educational institutions has become an industry in itself.  Although the purpose of education is to develop people�s capabilities wholistically, contemporary education is increasingly commercially-led and operates within a �banking model�: courses are a means to an end, a means to learning what is required to get a good grade, a certificate or degree. The credential and the grade matters more than the subject or the process of learning. 
While recognising the inevitable link between education credentials and employment, this course will enable students to think �outside the market box�. It will explore the perspectives of critical educators, such as Paulo Freire, bell hooks, Henry Giroux, Paula Allman and Michael Apple, people who have been both theorists and practitioners of liberatory education inside and outside the formal education sector. 
Having a critical perspective on education also means examining the internal dynamics of the current education system. Is education equally enabling of people with disabilities, women, carers and older people? Is the idea of meritocracy an unrealisable myth in an economically unequal society?  Is education, as Bourdieu has suggested, simply a means of reproducing the class and ethnic/racial structures of society? 
Education is a moral enterprise; given this, what are the moral compasses guiding education presently both organisationally and intellectually? These are the kinds of questions the course will address. The emphasis will be on developing your own critical analysis of the relationship between education and society; it is about developing a new educational imaginary. 
","On successful completion of this module students will have developed:
1.	A strong understanding of critical pedagogy and critical thinking in education.
2.	A sound knowledge of the work of critical educators 
3.	The analytical skills to critically interrogate issues in education theory, practice and policy.
4.	The ability to review how education intersects with social systems generating inequalities for specific social groups.
5.	The ability to reflect on their own educational experiences and situate that experiential knowledge within an academic framework.
6.	The creative skills to think about alternative ways of organising society and the role of education in creating egalitarian social change.

201700,EEEN,30150,Electrical and Electronic Eng,Modelling and Simulation,Modelling and Simulation,5,SEM_2,"In practical engineering it is very common for a professional design and/or analysis procedure to lead to a system of equations which must be solved.  These equations may be linear or nonlinear. There may be a single equation or a system of several equations. The equations may be algebraic, transcendental or differential. In the latter case they may be ordinary or partial differential equations and may be subject to a variety of initial or boundary-value conditions.  In short, appropriate modelling translates the problem of determining performance of an engineering system into the problem of solving equations. Very few of these equations permit simple, analytic solutions so that in practice one must resort to numerical methods to solve them and indeed this is what scientists and engineers have been forced to do for centuries at least. Efficient numerical algorithms for solving standard forms of equations were in many cases developed and employed long before the advent of the modern computer. The purpose of this module is to consider some of the better and most popular, but simpler algorithms for solving the kind of equations which most commonly present themselves in the practical application of mathematics.  Illustrative examples are drawn from across the range of engineering disciplines. It is appropriate that any course on numerical methods should involve hands-on dealing with the problem of solving actual equations (i.e. equations which arise from actual physical and/or engineering problems). Accordingly the delivery and assessment of this module will require implementation of the various algorithms by the student for the purpose of solving real problems drawn from all branches of engineering. The adopted numerical platform will be m-files within MATLAB. As well as being widely-used, this platform permits focus upon algorithms, as distinct from code, and easy comparison of the student-written algorithmic performance with performance of professionally developed algorithms. Assignments will take the form of laboratories and minor projects. Students will select from a list drawn from a wide range of engineering and science problems and solve using the techniques presented in lectures and practiced in laboratories.

Outline: Solving nonlinear equations:  Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newton-Raphson. Optimisation: Fermat condition, Newton�s method, Lagrange and KKT multipliers, curve fitting. Solving systems of linear equations:  Gaussian elimination with pivoting, Gauss-Seidel. Solving ordinary differential equations, initial value problems: Euler, Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashforth-Moulton. Numerical Quadrature: Newton-Cotes, Gauss Quadrature. Solving ordinary differential equations, boundary value problems: finite differences. Solving partial differential equations (parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic): finite differences, Crank-Nicolson, Von Neumann stability.

Learning Outcomes Rationale:

LO1:  Many engineering, scientific, economic, etc problems give rise to the mathematical problem of solving a nonlinear equation or a system thereof. Few nonlinear equations permit analytic solution and one must perforce resort to numerical methods.

LO2: Likewise many engineering, scientific, economic, etc problems approximately give rise to the mathematical problem of solving a system of linear equations. Whereas such systems may be solved analytically the task exceeds human computation capability if the number of equations is large, as it commonly is in practice. In these circumstances we resort to numerical methods and seek great efficiency.

LO3: Very many engineering, scientific, economic, etc problems give rise to the mathematical problem of solving a system of first order ordinary differential equations subject to given initial conditions. The great majority of these equations cannot be solved analytically and numerical methods must be employed. Whereas tables of data or graphs can of course be used to present the results, 3D graphics and ani","On successful completion of this module the student will be able to:

1. Approximately numerically solve a given algebraic or transcendental equation or system of such equations, appreciate the level of approximation involved and understand some of the more common problems which can occur and how to remedy them.  Leverage this ability to approximately numerically identify the local maxima and minima of functions, both subject to constraints and otherwise.

2. Efficiently numerically solve a system of linear equations and/or invert a matrix, even when the number of variables becomes relatively large. Have an appreciation of ill-conditioning and of sparsity.

3. Efficiently numerically solve a system of first order differential equations subject to given initial conditions. Be able to use this ability to determine the actual performance of a significant class of engineering systems. Again appreciate the approximation involved, the problems which can occur, how to identify them and what to do if they arise. Present results in a manner more engaging than a simple table or graph.

4. Approximately numerically solve boundary value problems and Dirichlet/Neumann problems for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, specifically Laplace�s equation, the heat equation and the wave equation. The algorithms presented are widely recognised as being the simplest, but not the best.

5. Produce a 3D graphical representation of an object and animate in MATLAB. Recognise the importance of quality of presentation of data/reports and improve personal effectiveness in this regard.

Martin McDonagh:Theatre and Screen plays.
Best known for the movie In Bruges and the play The Beauty Queen of Leenane,  Martin McDonagh  has been regarded as a controversial writer for over a decade and critical opinion is almost evenly split, some regarding his as a charlatan, others as a creative genius. Evaluations of  Martin McDonagh's work to date have relied substantially on the complex relationship between  space, language, character and action. He has written eight plays to date and three screen plays. Much of the discussion around McDonagh's work is based on how he frames irishness and many of the controversies are around how violence is staged or enacted.

This module will consider the plays in detail as well as analyse the critical responses and contextualizations of the work. It will consider how appropriate it is to place the work within an Irish tradition and/or whether it is more important to situate the work in a broader world wide context.

Later, Carl Jung diagnosed the distinctive illness of the twentieth century as that of a godless age in search of meaning. The twentieth century witnesses a rejection of old, official myths (God, the immortal soul, the nation state, etc.), which are supplanted by new ones that first emerge in so-called low, popular culture. Fantasy texts address various crises of meaning, by providing readers and audiences with new myths, new gods. This course will explore the connections between fantasy, popular media and crises in the conception of the modern self, as mapped through events such as WWII, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, the triumph of late capitalism, and present-day fundamentalist terrorism. Sigmund Freud asserts that fantasy fulfills unconscious wishes, or 'lacks'. What do our enduring popular myths of roughly the last 100 years reveal about us, individually and collectively? Why are characters like Aslan, Superman, Batman and Bilbo Baggins such enduring figures of the modern imagination, easily translating from medium to medium (cheap paperbacks and comics, to film and TV)? Do they represent a hunger for old authority? Or, could they be archetypes of new humanist liberation? The course will address these questions and others through analysis of a selection of key comics and fantasy texts, including the following:

J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit; Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman: Year One; Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins; C.S.

We will look at a range of Irish writing, examining its thematic preoccupations, its formal innovations and its ongoing reception by readers in a variety of fora (online media, printed media, etc) The course will include a range of short fiction including work by Claire Keegan, Colin Barrett and Danielle McLaughlin, and recent novels by Kevin Barry, Anne Enright and Mike McCormack. The turn to the past in contemporary Irish fiction (judged by some critics as literary opportunity and others as disabling obsession) will be a central theme of the course as will fictional imaginings of alternative futures.  Finally, in analysing the depiction of contemporary Irish society by writers ranging from Barrett and McCormack to McLaughlin and Enright we will engage with ongoing debates concerning the function of literary representation in the context of social crisis and change. Did a literature of the Celtic Tiger exist, and what in the years 2017-2018 are its literary successors?

Unless they are members of a First Nation�s or Metis community, all those who reside in Canada are either first generation immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. It is often true, therefore, that two --- and sometimes more --- homelands are carried in the imaginations of Canadian writers: an abandoned homeland and an adopted homeland. This could also be said to be true of First Nations writers who have either lost their ancestral tribal lands completely or have seen those lands altered beyond all recognition as the result of government policies and the introduction of wave after wave of settlers. 
This course will examine the effects of migration and subsequent attempts at emplacement as seen through the eyes of Canada�s writers, both First Nations writers and those who are in Canada as a result of immigration. It will also look at attempts at cultural sovereignty (from the nationalistic 1960s to the more globally minded present) as exemplified by various trends in Canada�s publishing world and in the government strategy pertaining to that world.
Essentially reading and discussion based, the module will also include a creative component. Students will be required to produce one work of non-fiction (of approximately 3000 words) examining the idea of migration as their own family --- or as a family or individual known to them --- has experienced it. Research methods for this work may include sketches, photos, interviews and recordings, as well as library and archival research. Memory, or the concept of the memoir, may also play a significant role in the creation of this work, as well as family legend, folklore, or even gossip and rumour. The notion of migration may also be opened up and re-defined to include any significant shift of location; from rural to urban for example, or even a shift of position, class, or income level.<br>

Required Reading
The Penguin Book of Canadian Short Stories, selected and edited by Jane Urquhart, including such immigration/emigration stories as �The View From Castle Rock� by Alice Munro, �The Lost Salt Gift of Blood� by Alistair Macleod, �Gussy and the Boss� by Sam Selvon, �The Collectors� by Rohinton Mistry, �Last Rites� by Moyez Vassanji, �One Story, One Song� by Richard Wagamese, and �Voices Lost in Snow� by ex-patriot Canadian writer Mavis Gallant to name a few.","Upon completion of this module the student should be able to 
1. discuss the idea of emplacement, migration and immigration in the multi-cultural nation of Canada as exemplified by the narratives developed by Canadian authors from many different backgrounds, 
2. open up this discussion to examine how emplacement, migration, immigration, and emigration plays out in the narratives of both the country of arrival and the country of embarkation,
3. discuss the notion of how significant personal changes of place, self, income, and identity can be looked at as a form of migration/immigration/emigration or a combination of all three 
4. create one�s own narrative of migration based on one�s own experience or an experience that one has been made aware of by a family member or a friend."

So wrote Francis Bacon in his 1625 essay �On Revenge�, and the complex issues he raises are explored in this module in relation to some of the revenge tragedies that were performed on the Renaissance stage.  Adapted for the stage from the Senecan tradition, revenge tragedy was probably the most popular genre on the Renaissance stage, and one to which Shakespeare famously contributed with Hamlet.  This module examines Shakespeare's other revenge tragedy (Titus Andronicus) alongside other notable examples: The Revenger's Tragedy, The Maid's Tragedy, and Tis Pity She�s a Whore.  This module attempts to account for the genre's popularity, exploring the way it gave playgoers of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods opportunities to reflect on issues as diverse as authority, subjectivity, justice, religion, sex and trauma.

Recent research on Jane Austen has shown convincingly that her work was very much engaged with the Britain of her time, and perhaps more importantly, that she was deeply interested in the writings of her contemporaries, from dramatists to poets, novelists or commentators.  Austen was far from the lone literary genius of her generation; in fact the time in which she lived saw a flowering of female talents�women carved out careers as playwrights, historians, social commentators, poets and novel-writers, in greater numbers than ever before. Contrary to received opinion, Austen was not the most popular novelist of her day--her female and male contemporaries easily outsold her.  It is instructive then, to read Austen in the context of her peers, and to read her deeply, rather than simply enjoying her as a costume drama. 

'Austen in Context' will tackle more challenging concepts and material of the Romantic era, focusing on Austen�s work, and that of other writers of the period.  Key concepts to be studied include sensibility and the gothic, among others, and we will also consider Austen�s relation to the British Empire and abolition.  Students will be expected to move beyond conventional interpretations of Austen and her contemporaries, and to show initiative, critical discernment and originality when approaching both canonical and non-canonical works.

However, if this data is not cared for, it will not be accessible in the future. Until recently, preservation, applied well after the digital item was created, had been the main method used to maintain digital materials over time. However, new technologies have raised additional challenges beyond which preservation can address. It has become clear that maintaining digital material needs to start before the point of creation, to ensure continued access over time. This course provides an introduction to the digital curation lifecycle as a strategy to manage the creation, conservation, and preservation of and long term access to digital materials.

 - the discipline by which an organisation in any industry assesses,

 stakeholders

ERM is different from traditional approaches to risk management. These operate
within specific risk types or silos e.g. credit, market, operational, business,
compliance and are rarely managed with a view to the overall exposure of the
business. ERM seeks to be different. Its objective is to consider all risks in a
holistic way using this perspective to identify:
1. gaps in risk management
2. opportunities to diversify or self-hedge within and across risks.
ERM has developed a technology and language of its own. Students will be
introduced to concepts of economic capital, risk appetite, earnings at risk,
scenario analysis and risk integration as part of this module.
The learning objective for this module is straightforward. By the end of these
sessions I would expect students to develop and provide an informed view on
the appropriateness and usefulness of ERM in the management of risk in
modern financial organisations.

We will ask where the early Welsh and Irish considered their origins to be, and consider Arthur in his role of a Celtic hero. From the Renaissance onwards we look at the gradual rediscovery of the Celts and how they are reinvented and reconstructed to fit in with contemporary objectives. Then we examine the beginnings of the scientific study of the Celtic languages and how this led to the rise of Pan-Celticism, and finally we evaluate the claims of the practitioners of Celtic spirituality.",1.

However, as is often the case with ideals, the reality is sometimes very different. This module will focus on several novels and novellas from German Modernist literature, Robert Walser's ""Jakob von Gunten"", Robert Musil's ""Die Verwirrungen des jungen Toerless"" and Arthur Schnitzler's ""Der Sohn"". Like much Modernist prose, these works are as much about the form of experience as well as its content, looking at the unique way each individual experiences the world, and sometimes flounders in it. We see a commentary on things such as value systems, power relations, gender and social status. In some instances, the narratives reveal an ambivalence not often mentioned in common expectations (and idealisations) of youth. In places, some of the texts place more negative experiences of youthfulness in the spotlight: they don't shy away from themes such as bullying, exclusion, and the experience of ""difference"".

The protagonists have hopes, fears and crises of identity on many levels. Walser, Musil and Schnitzler in these works show the threshold between youth and adulthood, innocence and guilt, self-assurance and anxiety, and in the midst of this, the young protagonists' struggles to find a voice.

It engages students in developing critical awareness of how the legal education and the practice of law shapes both legal norms and the outcomes of legal processes. 

The module combines the development of legal skills with the acquisition of a deeper understanding of the legal system.  We consider evidence as to what lawyers do and why. The professional practice of lawyers involves the acquisition and retention of clients, finding out their circumstances and preferences, articulating the law in its potential, but also bearing in mind the practicality of recourse to the law.  We examine how lawyers charge for their services, and what ethical dilemnas may arise consequent on countervailing commercial influences on lawyer and client.

We will use a series of simulations to experience how lawyers gather information and instructions from their clients and use their professional knowledge to advance the interests of their clients through advising and then negotiating on their behalf, or acting as advocates for them.  Central to this activity is the development of writing skills for legal drafting and other forms of writing.  We will experience and evaluate the significance of drafting processes for advancing client issues. Finally we will examine the various mechanisms through which professional values are implemented and enforced through the actions of professionals themselves and their firms and through the oversight and enforcement by both professional and governmental bodies. We will examine the relative balance between self-regulation and public regulation, and tensions between professional autonomy and the claims of state actors to intervene in the name both of competition and regulatory ordering.","On completing this course, students should be able to:	

Discuss, and engage reflectively with, the impact of law for participants in legal processes;

The idea of a continuous function is central to the study of calculus and mathematical analysis. As functions came to be defined on spaces much more complicated than the real line, the plane, 3-space and so on, it became necessary to formulate a definition of continuity that could be applied in as many situations as possible. Following the revolutionary ideas of Cantor in the 1880s and the invention of set theory, progress in this regard came swiftly with the introduction of 'metric spaces' in 1906, the more general 'topological spaces' in 1914, and the corresponding definitions of continuity, by Fr�chet and Hausdorff, respectively.

Students must have a minimum of 5 years industry experience to take this module.

This course provides real-world, hands-on learning on how to identify an opportunity within students own companies and how to exploit that idea to commercial reality (intra-preneurship, or corporate entrepreneurship). 

This class is not about how to write a business plan.  �This is a practical class, essentially a lab, not a theory or book class. Our goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create a intra-preneurship/corporate entrepreneurship experience for you with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start-up.  It will be hands-on talking to customers, partners and competitors as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how to fully exploit an opportunity within your own organisations.  

You will work in teams, learning how to turn an idea into a new business. You will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone other than you would want/use your product.  Finally, based on the customer and market feedback you gathered, you will use agile development to rapidly iterate your product and turn it into something your customers would actually use and buy. Each block will be a new adventure outside the classroom as you test each part of your business model and then share the hard-earned knowledge with the rest of the class.

Class Culture: Communication in a start-up is very different from that in a university or large company.  The culture is dramatically different from the university culture most of you are familiar with. At times it can feel brusque and impersonal, but in reality it is focused and oriented to create immediate action in time- and cash-constrained environments.  We have limited time, and we push, challenge and question you in the hope that you will quickly learn. We will be direct, open and tough, just like in the real world. We hope you can recognize that these comments are not personal, but part of the process. We also expect you to question us, challenge our point of view if you disagree and engage in a real dialogue with the teaching team. This approach may seem harsh, but it is all part of our desire that you learn to challenge yourselves quickly and objectively, and to appreciate that as entrepreneurs you need to learn and evolve faster than you ever imagined possible. 

Amount of Work : This class requires a significant amount of work on your part.  Projects are treated as real start-ups, so the workload will be intense. Getting out of the classroom is what the effort is about. It is not about the lectures. You will be spending a significant amount of time between each of the lectures outside your lab talking to customers. This is a customer-centric approach to understanding solving problems.  This class is a simulation of what start-ups and entrepreneurship are like in the real world, with all its chaos, uncertainly, impossible deadlines, conflicting input, etc. This class pushes many people past their comfort zone.  It is not about you, but it is also not about the class or the teaching team. This is what start-ups are like (and the class is just a small part of what it is really like). The pace and the uncertainty pick up as the class proceeds. 

Team Organisation : This class is team-based. Working and studying will be done in teams. You will be admitted as a team. We want you before you come to the first class to think of ideas or products that you could use for this course. You should use your own companies as the initial source of ideas.  At the first class we will run an ideation process where we will help the class come up with ideas.Team projects can be software, a physical product or a service of any kind.

This module will introduce these concepts in the context of commercial projects, to show how they are used in business settings. However, this module will focus on the more advanced and proven techniques from industry. Classroom workshops and discussions will reinforce the learning.
At the heart of value generation is the issue of who participates in the project. This brings to the surface the primary decisions that determine which parties are best prepared, suited and equipped to undertake specific parts of the project. This leads to determining how to best procure the required resources. While a portion of every project is undertaken in-house, often most of the project work is outsourced.

Thermodynamics topics are concerned with the ways energy is stored and how energy transformations, which involve heat and work, may take place. These principles are applicable, for example, to heat engines used for power generation, to internal combustion enines used for vehicle propulsion, to refrigeration systems and heat pumps used for cooling and heating, and to liquid pumps and water turbines, such as those used in hydro-electric power stations. 
This course focuses strongly on study of the principle of conservation of Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics) and on its application to quantitative problems arising in practical engineering situations. Study of properties of pure substances is also required, as is familiarisation with tables of Thermodynamic fluid properties. Fluids considered include ideal gases and other substances where liquid-vapour mixtures occur. 
Heat transfer topics will include analysis of one-dimensional steady state heat transfer problems, such as those that arise in study of heat exchangers and in analysis of heat losses through walls and windows of buildings.

201700,MEEN,30140,Mech and Materials Engineering,Professional Eng. (Finance),Professional Engineering (Finance),5,SEM_2,"This Accounting and Finance Module may appear to some to be outside the typical scope of study normally attributed to Engineering, but Engineers, like many professionals, either undertake or are responsible for a wide range of business activities which ultimately affect the economic performance of the organisation.  And how is the economic performance of an organisation managed?   By measuring (�If you�re not Measuring � you�re not Managing�). 
Measuring economic performance in a business context invariably introduces money-values. And this leads one into the field of accounting for costs and revenues.  Engineers must therefore be familiar with the concepts, not just of financial accounting itself, but more importantly, in the analysis of accounts, the assessment of the cost-benefit of projects, costing, budgeting, and similar measuring techniques which will impact on the work of Engineers during their careers.
While this module has the objective of providing Engineers with the basic accounting and financial management skills required to meet the foregoing needs, it is not intended as a foundation accounting course, and hence avoids where possible the technical intricacies of �double-entry� book-keeping.  It focuses rather on the �bigger picture� of understanding the underlying features of compiling and analysing financial statements, and developing good quality financial information needed for effective decision-making.

The number of children with asthma in Ireland has increased significantly over the last decade, with no obvious cause.  While the vast majority of children with asthma are treated by general practitioners, acute exacerbations of asthma account for a significant proportion of winter hospitalisations in paediatrics. Recent studies in the literature examine the role of the newer treatments available for asthma, the most common chronic lung disease in children.
Ireland has one of the highest incidences of cystic fibrosis (CF) worldwide, yet is one of the last countries to introduce newborn  CF screening. Newborn CF screening was introduced in July 2011 in the Republic of Ireland and will provide both new challenges and opportunities for all doctors caring for children and their families.
Paediatric allergic disorders are increasingly more commonly seen both in general practice and hospital medicine. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of acute paediatric hospitalisation in children <1 year of age and may have significant and long term complications. Bacterial pneumonia continues to remain a significant cause of morbidity and incorrectly treated may lead to significant complications e.g. empyema requiring surgery etc. Laryngo tracheo bronchitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, foreign body aspiration, congenital airway and lung lesions, chronic lung disease of prematurity and sleep disordered breathing are disorders seen regularly in a paediatric population requiring specific treatment and referral pathways.

201700,PATH,30220,Medicine,Rare Genetic Disorders,Rare Genetic Disorders,5,SEM_2,"A disease or disorder is defined as rare when it affects less than 1 in 2000 individuals. It is estimated that there are between 6000 and 8000 rare disorders clinically identified.  Approximately 80% of these rare disorders are genetic in origin, with infections, allergies and environmental influences accounting for the remaining 20% of presentations.  Although individually rare, taken together it is estimated that these diseases may affect up to 157,000 people living in Ireland today and up to 30 million citizens of the European Union.  There is a lack of awareness among medical professionals about rare conditions and more often than not, the diagnosis of these disorders in individuals is a long and grueling process for the patient. 
This module is designed to enhance awareness of rare genetic disorders among future medical professionals. It aims to do this by creating a reflective and unique learning experience for students.  This module has a strong clinical slant with representations by patient support and advocacy groups for rare genetic disorders.  Selected rare disorders will be highlighted and the impact of these diseases on the patients and their families will be explored.  The importance of research to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will also be covered.  Economic and political aspects will also be discussed.

201700,MDCS,40160,Medicine,Hip and Musculoskeletal Tumour,Hip and Musculoskeletal Tumours,5,SEM_2,"The hip joint is the joint between the femur and acetabulum of the pelvis and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static and dynamic postures. As it is a major weight bearing joint, patients can present with a wide variety of principally degenerative conditions. Recent evidence indicates that most if not all hip arthritis is a secondary condition and not 'idiopathic' as previously thought. Total hip replacement (THR) is a surgical procedure that relieves pain from most kinds of hip arthritis, improving the quality of life for the large majority of patients who undergo the operation. Patients commonly undergo THR after non-operative treatments have failed to provide relief from arthritis symptoms. Most scientific studies that have followed patients for more than 10 years have found 'success rates' of over 90 percent following traditional THR. However, as understanding of the underlying causes of hip arthritis expands, new surgical interventions are currently being used at an early stage in order to prevent later joint degeneration and need for THR.
Musculoskeletal tumours are relatively rare conditions which can result in significant morbidity to the patient. The prognosis of patients with musculoskeletal tumours has improved markedly in recent years because of the advent of new chemotherapeutic drugs and regimes and because of advances in imaging and surgical techniques. Limb-salvage operations can currently be performed with better outcomes, while in the past, limbs with tumours were treated with only amputation. Early diagnosis is critical and clinical features associated with bone tumours include pain, deformity, and impairment of function. Pain is a feature common to almost all malignant tumours of bone but may also be present in benign lesions. Accurate preoperative surgical staging of musculoskeletal tumours currently is possible because of advanced imaging techniques, which is important because the images provide prognostic information and aid clinicians in choosing the most appropriate treatment option for the patient.

This module will discuss the hip, in relation to anatomy, biomechanics, pathophysiology and current management principles of hip disorders. The module will also cover the basic pathology, diagnosis and principles of management of musculoskeletal tumours.","At the end of this module, students will be expected to have an understanding of:
a)	Anatomy of the hip
b)	Clinical examination of the hip
c)	Pathophysiology of common hip conditions
d)	Operative and Non-operative management of hip conditions
e)	Benign and Malignant musculoskeletal tumours

201700,MDCS,40170,Medicine,Knee and Sports Related Orthop,Knee and Sports Related Orthopaedics,5,SEM_2,"Since in humans the knee supports nearly the entire weight of the body is the most vulnerable both to acute injury and to the development of osteoarthritis. The knee can be thought of as a self-maintaining, biologic transmission that functions to accept and transfer biomechanical loads between the femur, tibia, patella, and fibula. In this analogy the ligaments represent non-rigid adaptable sensate linkages within the biologic transmission. The articular cartilages act as bearing surfaces, and the menisci as mobile bearings. In sports that place great stress on the knees, especially with twisting forces, it is common to tear one or more ligaments or cartilages. The anterior cruciate ligament is often torn as a result of a rapid direction change while running or as a result of some other type of violent twisting motion. Knee ligament reconstruction is commonly performed for the unstable knee. Knee arthroplasty is a commonly performed operation done to relieve the pain and disability from rheumatoid arthritis or more often osteoarthritis of the knee. Newer surgical techniques have also been developed that attempt to regenerate damaged host tissue and prevent later knee joint degeneration and knee replacement.
Sports medicine is an interdisciplinary subspecialty of medicine which deals with the treatment and preventive care of athletes, both amateur and professional. The sports medicine ""team"" includes specialty physicians and surgeons, athletic trainers, physical therapists, coaches, other personnel, and, of course, the athlete. Its function is not only curative and rehabilitative, but also preventative, which may actually be the most important one of all. The high stresses to which the athlete subjects his/her body increase the risk of injury. The injuries that occur depend on the sport in question. Participation in all forms of physical activity at all levels is a huge part of everyday life, and its benefits to health and quality of life are clear. Sports medicine's continued growth and development may help the benefits of physical activity to be fully and safely realized.

This module will discuss the knee, in relation to anatomy, biomechanics, pathophysiology and current management principles of knee disorders. The module will also discuss sports medicine and the principles of management of sports injuries.","At the end of this module, students will be expected to have an understanding of:

201700,MDCS,40180,Medicine,Foot and Ankle and Peripheral,Foot and Ankle and Peripheral Nerve and Tendon Injuries,5,SEM_2,"The ankle is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus in the foot. The foot and ankle have a complicated osseous and ligamentous support structure. Failure of any part of this can results in pain and deformity of the foot. More than 11 million visits per year are made to doctors' offices in the US alone because of foot, toe and ankle problems, including such entities as hallux valgus, osteochondral defects and arthritis and more than 2 million visits for ankle sprains and strains and more than 800,000 visits for ankle fractures.
Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) are frequently a result of acute traumatic and chronic repetitive injury. Stretch-related injuries are the most common type. Lacerations such as those created by a knife blade are another common PNI type, comprising 30% of serious injuries in some series. Compression is a third common type of PNI. These include the 'Saturday Night palsy' due to radial nerve compression as well as entrapment neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The relatively exposed position of peripheral nerves and tendons leaves them open to injury. This injury can result in significant functional disability and appropriate assessment and management is necessary to ensure a satisfactory outcome.","At the end of this module, students will be expected to have an understanding of:

Biomechanics is the field of study which makes use of the laws of physics and engineering concepts to describe motion of body segments, and the forces which act upon them during activity. Orthopaedics surgeons make wide usage of a variety of materials and bearing surfaces, with tribology being the study of how bearing surfaces interact. Other current topical issues include the development of gene based therapies, research into infection and the study in inflammation. 
Physical therapy is the provision of services to people and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. It includes the provision of services in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by the process of aging or that of injury or disease. Adequate rehabilitation after an injury or orthopaedic intervention is key to ensuring that full restoration of function occurs.

However, advances in molecular medicine raise the prospect of using DNA, RNA and protein information in novel ways to match medical treatment better to individual needs.  Both the discovery and the application of personalised molecular medicine strategies present considerable challenges in the face of large quantities of data, which need to be managed appropriately and interpreted correctly.This module takes an informatics approach to understanding the development of personalised molecular medicine.

Know that modern medicine is facing a personalised information deluge. The scale of available data increases greatly the number of medical hypotheses worth testing. However, traditional means of establishing evidence-based strategies for managing patients are not scaling in proportion. 

Know that routine genotyping and sequencing will transform the management of serious inherited genetic diseases from being driven primarily by the phenotype to being driven primarily by the genotype. 

Know that pronounced somatic genetic differences among cancers are leading to stratified or precision medicine approaches. These take the tumour genetic background into account.  However the high levels of inter and intra-individual heterogeneity of cancer and the ability of cancers to evolve resistance against variable components of the cancer phenotype present challenges to this approach. 

Know that in many complex diseases, inherited genotypic variation is frequently difficult to incorporate usefully into clinical practise, while molecular analysis of phenotypic subtypes (RNA and protein) will lead to some specific advances in the near future.

Alongside it �alternative facts�, �fake news� and similar terms have become more and more commonplace. Expertise appears to be discredited, gut feeling at least as important as facts, and facts themselves no longer valid and reliable. How and why did we get to this point, are there ways out of it, and has it really become impossible to distinguish between facts and their different interpretations? 
This module will track philosophical, sociological and political concepts that shaped today�s competing world views, beginning with the enlightenment. The module�s core hypothesis is that since the late nineteenth century the focus of academic attention shifted more and more from the observation of the world around us (�realism�) to the way in which our societal and individual predispositions, the unconscious part of our brain and our emotions influence how we perceive and interpret that world. We will follow this trajectory starting with Nietzsche via Freud�s psychoanalysis and Popper and Kuhn�s theories of scientific progress up to poststructuralist and postmodern positions which appear to aid a complete relativism in which �anything goes�. The module will conclude with recent pushbacks against these tendencies, including calls for a �new realism� and neuro-scientific findings regarding the interaction of perception and emotion. All of these concepts will be interrogated with an eye on how they relate to issues of morality and fairness � concepts that are conspicuously absent among post-truthers and bullshitters. Finally we will look at the significant impact of the internet on our behaviour and our ways to gain and assess information. 
In the first class of each week we will discuss a philosophical or sociological concept while looking at how it is embodied by a piece of music � usually an opera � in the second hour (after all, I'm a music lecturer). Room will be given to questions raised by students with regard to issues they are particularly concerned about.

-	identify and evaluate facts as opposed to opinions/interpretations

-	reassess the values of rational thinking and emotional engagement in relation to different types of discursive situations
-	gain a deepened understanding of a range of intellectual concepts such as enlightened rationality, positivism, objectivity, relativism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, post-truth, bullshit and others
-	gain insights into how music is shaped by societal forces and can in turn shape it on occasion

Socrates is something of a puzzle: because he himself wrote nothing, any attempt to piece together his thought and character must investigate what his contemporaries wrote about him. We will be examining in particular those writings that bear on the trial and death of Socrates. These include Plato's 'Apology', 'Euthyphro', and 'Crito', a series of short, lively dialogues that offer excellent introductions not only to Socrates, but to the practice of philosophy itself.

We will examine what these familiar concepts mean, what they assume, how they are used in ordinary situations, how two people might disagree about whether they apply in a certain situation. Where does ethical obligation come from, exactly? What is the difference between someone being responsible, someone taking responsibility, and someone being held responsible? If I forgive someone unconditionally, does this condone the wrong and show a lack of self-respect?

In the second half of the course we will begin by considering the following questions: are there irreducibly moral facts, or are moral facts really just facts about non-moral matters? Are there objective moral facts, or are moral facts always relative to an individual or group? We will then critically examine two competing moral theories: consequentialism, the view that whether an action is right or wrong ultimately depends on the consequences of the action; and deontological ethics, the view that whether an action is right or wrong ultimately depends on whether it conforms to ethical principles.

That is because debates in the philosophy of language have been seen as providing the means to answer questions in virtually every other area of philosophy. For example, questions about what terms like 'phlogiston' or 'Sherlock Holmes' can bear on questions about the metaphysical nature of non-existents; questions about the correct interpretation of the conditions under which sentences like 'stealing from the needy is wrong' can shed light on the nature of moral facts. Questions concerning language and the nature of meaning have been at the center of twentieth century philosophy. Moreover,  philosophy of language has been the defining theme of the analytic tradition in philosophy. This course aims to introduce students to key issues and debates in contemporary philosophy of language by concentrating on the dual themes of meaning and reference. The course takes a historical-thematic approach. In the first section   we look at the development of core themes in philosophy of language by  Quine, Davidson, Chomsky, Kripke and Putnam.  In the second part, the  course will focus on a number of debates in recent philosophy of language, and investigate some of the wider philosophical significance of those debates.","By the end of this course students will be familiar with key issues and debates in contemporary philosophy of language. They will have an understanding of the abstract issues relating to the intersection between language, mind and the world, of some more concrete questions of uses of language in extreme conditions of hate, prejudice and political coercion, and of howto employ methods in the philosophy of language to answer questions in other areas of philosophy."

This module will examine the themes of (1) subjectivity, (2) freedom, (3) politics, and (4) history as explored by the four most influential of the German Idealist Philosophers, Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Each of these philosophers provides a distinctive contribution to the principle that human beings can accept nothing unless it is explicable through reasons (this is the principle of autonomy). This module will examine the various ways in which this principle leads to the liberation of selfhood, morality, and the political subject from any notion that they are simply pieces of nature.","(1)	Familiarity with the distinguishing characteristics of German Idealism
(2)	An appreciation of the differences between the main philosophers of German Idealism

We will begin by asking whether there is a 'demarcation criterion' that allows us to distinguish scientific theories from other theories and human practices, such as astrology, homeopathy, or creationism (often called 'pseudo-sciences'). The course has five parts, covering the following issues. First, we will look at the most important attempts to characterize science by its method. This will lead us to the philosophical problem of induction and we will discuss the nature of scientific explanation. Second, we consider the issue of theory change and the skeptical challenge that there is no objective progress in science, because different scientific paradigms are 'incommensurable'. The third part addresses metaphysical questions concerning the debate about scientific realism (and anti-realism). In the forth part, we ask whether there is a divide between the natural and the social sciences and whether the explanation of human actions is fundamentally different from the explanation of natural events. The final part addresses the question of whether science can (and should) be value-neutral. We will look at the work of feminist philosophers who have argued that gender-biases have distorted scientific research.","Students who successfully complete this course will have (1) a good grasp of the central issues in the philosophy of science, (2) engaged critically with the most important views and arguments in this area, and (3) developed some independent thoughts and arguments on some of those issues."

201700,PHIL,20560,Philosophy,Selves & Others:Perspectives,"Selves & Others:Perspectives from Philosophy, Cognitive Science & Virtual Reality",5,SEM_2,"Rationale:
Students in philosophy will benefit from a course such as this one which shows how philosophical insights and arguments can gear into scientific discovery and practice.  Students in psychology, psychiatry and the human sciences engaged in projects related to social cognition would benefit from a subject such as this which examines a variety of conceptual frameworks.  These conceptual frameworks would provide a useful interpretative base and they could also inform experimental design and the analysis of experimental data. This subject thus aims to provide means for addressing the rather common complaint these days that we are 'data rich and theory poor'.  Students will improve their interrogative strategies, their analyitical skills and be able to discuss their findings more effecively with their peers and also non-specialist audiences.

Subject Description:
Descartes writes in his Meditations that gazing out his window at the passersby, he wondered how he could be sure that beneath the hats and cloaks were real human beings not just automatons. Even though Descartes identified this problem of other minds, he did not directly address it as such.  Descartes' early articulation of �the problem of other minds' has inspired much philosophical debate since the early 20th century.  Today such debates in philosophy are being driven in significant part by the development of the domains of cognitive science, artificial intelligence and virtuality. These are fast-expanding areas of research with relevance to philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, cognitive science, anthropology, evolutionary theory, criminology and ethics.  New findings are coming to light which challenge and reconfigure our understandings of humans as intelligent, embodied, social beings.  The relation between selves and others marks a key investigation in philosophy which principally addresses the question � how is it possible that from one subject's seemingly self-enclosed interiority, this subject may come to know that an-Other is minded in the same way as she is? That is, that this Other enjoys all the mental states that the subject enjoys � beliefs, desires, intentions, imaginations, and emotion � and that these may constitute reasons for action.  The debates today are expanding to include further concerns - the mindedness of non-human animals, the possibilities of there being ""zombies"" or the question of the philosophical status of androids and whether we are heading for what is ominously referred to as �the singularity� when robot intelligence will outrun human intelligence.  So too with the rapid advances in technology the domain of Virtuality is challenging our preconceptions regarding embodiment, identity and relations with others. Most recently, virtual reality is finding interesting applications in general medicine and also psychiatry. Virtuality has been described as the media of disembodiment wherein the mind is conceived as pure data and the body as mere vehicle. This view offers much appeal to some cultural theorists who propose that virtuality provides a means of transcending gender, race, class, disability, through a transcendence of the body � but is this the case? Could it be the case that in fact our understandings of embodiment have been too limited � that our bodies are not merely physical but also already incorporate the virtual?
","Students who successfully complete this subject will:

-gain a general understanding of the particular methodological approaches and theoretical accounts of phenomenology and the analytical tradition within philosophy; also of those within psychology and cognitive science � as they relate to understanding selves and others and the problem of other minds

-be able to identify and analyse some of the central themes and claims regarding the problem of other minds from the different traditions and disciplines

-have further developed their critical thinking skills by interrogating the viability of the various approaches advanced by key thinkers most particularly in their engagements with the current debates in the human sciences"

In the first half, we'll ask questions like: is our notion of God consistent? Are there any arguments for the existence of God that even an atheist could accept? Is the existence of a perfectly good God consistent with the existence of human and natural suffering? The second half will look at (i) the nature of religious faith, and the distinction between faith, fantasy and reason; (ii) the experience of gaining or losing faith; and (ii) the relation between a person's ethical beliefs and religious beliefs. (The module will speak of religion in general, but will use examples primarily drawn from Christianity.)","As a result of studying this course, students will (i) gain a good understanding of some of the key questions and theories in the philosophy of religion; (ii) gain the confidence to critically engage with classic and contemporary texts in the area; (iii) become familiar with central philosophical notions such as analysis, necessity and contingency, and counter-examples; and (iv) become familiar with key notions in the philosophy of religion such as faith, religious belief, theism and atheism, divinity, evil, and temporality."

This year we will consider the core value of freedom as central to modern political philosophy. We will trace how the concept of freedom developed via a range of key Enlightenment and contemporary thinkers, such as Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Sartre, Foucault, Arendt and Honneth. We will also explore modern critiques of freedom and the way it is conceptualised in relation to power, domination and inequality. We will consider questions such as: What does it mean to be free? Why is freedom such a cherished and protected value in modern societies? How can we be free in contexts in which legal and moral constraints are placed on our actions? Is it possible to consider freedom in isolation from other values such as equality, fairness or difference?","Students will gain knowledge of key thinkers and concepts in political philosophy. They will develop a capacity to contrast different ideas and texts and to offer a well informed and independent perspective on relevant debates; they will develop a capacity for writing, well-reasoned, accurate arguments in relation to key themes in political philosophy and to relate philosophical accounts to current social and political issues.

This course explores the intersections of philosophy and literature in the areas of alienation, dislocation and the post-human. By bringing major works of literature into conversation with key philosophical texts, the course interrogates our imagination and articulation of the human condition as well as the idea of the monstrous. We will study four to five key literary texts in conversation with shorter weekly philosophical readings. Literary texts will vary, but may include Frankenstein, The Year of the Flood, Never Let Me Go and The Stranger. Philosophical texts may include works by writers including Judith Butler, Rosi Braidotti, Albert Camus, Adorno and Horkheimer, Richard Rorty, Stanley Cavell and Martha Nussbaum.  

The module invites students to consider how philosophy and literature offer different perspectives on questions of empathy, narcissism and the self, and how the construction of the self depends on a projection of the other. Students will develop their existing critical skills to examine the formation of identity and power structures in different cultural contexts, thinking about how human/non-human binaries affect the development of the subject in economic and political systems. The course encourages students to think of diverse cultural ideas of the monstrous, and how these different images operate in different forms of discourse. Core themes emerging from discussion will include: 

> the imagination of the monstrous as a reflection of cultural values
> the role of fear in cultural praxis
> technology as a driver of and challenge to ethics 
> the forms, ethics and aesthetics of dislocation
> alienation as a cultural force in contemporary society
> what it may mean to be (post)human

How do feelings of others impact myself and my interaction with others? Are feelings morally significant? Is there a fundamental principle that grounds morality? Can it be ever morally permissible to break a promise? In what, if any sense, are we free to act? What kind of freedom is required for moral action? What is race? What is racism? Questions like these were controversially debated among eighteenth century moral philosophers and continue to be influential. In this module we will study moral theories that were developed in eighteenth century Scottish and German Enlightenment philosophy. Readings will include selected texts by Scottish philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and German philosopher Immanuel Kant.

201700,PHIL,30260,Philosophy,Philosophy of Law,Philosophy of Law,5,SEM_2,"This module will concern the philosophy of criminal law. We will start with the nature of responsibility, and compare moral and legal responsibility (liability). What does it mean to be responsible, to be held responsible, to take responsibility, and to deny responsibility? In law, one is held responsible if one has committed the crime with sufficient 'mens rea' (guilty mind). Mens rea can comprise intention, foreknowledge, recklessness and negligence, and we will examine each of these. Once the defendant pleads guilty to performing the act intentionally, she may then put forward an excuse or a justification for her conduct, and thereby hope for mitigation: was she provoked? was she under duress? was she acting in self-defence? was she ignorant? was she insane? We will examine all of these. We will also examine the problems associated with groups: conspiracy, incitement and complicity. Finally, we will examine different theories of punishment and mercy. Although knowledge of the criminal law is obviously useful, it is not essential.

(For background, you can check out this book in the library (free online version via UCD Connect): James R. O'Shea, _Kant's Critique of Pure Reason: An Introduction_, Routledge 2014 [Acumen 2012].)  Topics will include all or some of the following: scepticism and the nature of knowledge and belief; consciousness and the nature of the self; perception, identity, and causality; freedom, morality, and religion.  Hume's empiricist and sceptical naturalist outlook was famously opposed by the 'transcendental idealism' of Kant. Descendants of Humean and Kantian views are vital to disputes today across the spectrum from metaphysics and epistemology to aesthetics, morality, and political philosophy, so this course will provide important background for many of our level three courses. (Students should be aware that Kant's writing in particular is often difficult to grasp  and would be best approached by students who have already completed one or more philosophy modules.)","Having completed this module students should be able to articulate the central claims in the theories of knowledge of Hume and Kant, as well as being able to identify some of the leading characteristics of that period of thought known as the Enlightenment. Students will be able to understand and think creatively about central notions in epistemology and metaphysics, and gain facility with such concepts as empiricism, foundationalism, transcendental arguments, as well as problems concerning the nature of causal inference, our knowledge of space, time, substance and identity, and sceptical questions arising from problems of perception and objectivity.  One central learning outcome will be further developing one's ability to structure an argumentative essay in philosophy clearly and forcefully, along with  improving one's ability to produce good analytical, argument-based written work in general. 
[ NOTE for 2017-18: Students will be encouraged to grapple with Kant's challenging texts by attempting to summarize some of his arguments in their own words; three of these summaries will be submitted during the segment on Kant and will serve as a means for students to check their progress in understanding this difficult text. Crafting these summaries will also be crucial as students will then be expected to incorporate this work into their final essay.]"

Are politicians all the same � working only towards the protection of their own interests and not those of their constituents? Are the public truly disconnected from what goes on in Washington, Brussels and Dublin?  Representation is a cornerstone of modern democracy and yet how (and how effectively) the �will of the people� becomes public policy is anything but straightforward. This module attempts to untangle some of the complexity surrounding political representation. Students will be introduced to concepts such as substantive, descriptive and gyroscopic representation, the responsible party model, the difference between delegates and trustees, political responsiveness and the democratic dilemma. Using a combination of theoretical and empirical literature, the module addresses questions such as: What does it mean to be represented? What does �good� representation look like? Do citizens have influence over policy outcomes? Whose interests do politicians serve? Are elections good instruments of representation and how do institutions affect the party-voter link? Can women�s� interests only be fully articulated by other women?

Comparatively assess how political institutions and systems function as instruments of representative democracy.  Examine inequalities in representation, explore whether or not some groups are better represented than others and consider what consequences this has for public policy.

Common to all these problems is that they require shifts in values, policies, and different approaches to economic and public policy. 

The module attempts to identify answers to these questions: How do we resolve environmental disputes at a national or sub-national level? Why do some countries perform better from an environmental perspective? What kind of global environmental regimes are effective, and why? Can we change the fossil fuel basis of modern economies, and still provide jobs and public services?  Is the �green state� a feasible political idea?

In this course, students will study the patterns of environmental policy-making from an inter-disciplinary perspective incorporating comparative methods, environmental policy as resource management, environmental ethics, and the emerging field of green political economy in the context of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). 

All these topics are rooted in the most recent literature and, where applicable, linked to current policy debates in Ireland.  The course will conclude with a theoretical inquiry into the characteristics and nature of the �green state�: under what conditions is development compatible with environmental protection? Are there any examples of green states to study? What can other states learn from them?
","This module utilises a mix of methodological approaches. I will engage students by enquiring into environmental themes such as water, climate and deforestation so that scientific and policy-relevant information can be integrated into new theoretical conceptions of the environmental state. This approach will engage students in reflecting on environmental policy where it cuts across pre-conceived constructions of state and political policy preferences.  

The learning objectives for this course are: 
1. To impart skills in students so they understand global environmental problems from political perspectives in terms of the role of norms, institutions and interests at the national and international level. 

2. Students will seek out, select and interpret relevant empirical information in the context of problem solving and problem pressure across a range of topical environmental problems, both local and transboundary.

3. This module will engage students in a critical analysis of environmental values in the context of protest and opposition, and how to reflexively engage with epistemic as well as civil society stakeholders in deliberative policy assessments. 

Students will learn approaches to environmental problem solving using case studies and group projects. Each week students will be asked to present a project on a particular environmental theme or case, as well as selected readings.

It examines why and how states provide income supports for individuals and households, what direct effects these supports have on incomes and living standards, what indirect effects they may have by way of incentives for certain kinds of behaviour (e.g. in promoting employment), and how they relate to services that might provide alternative means of supporting well-being (e.g. childcare, job-training). The module considers income support for childhood, working age and old age separately and introduces various means to achieve this goal beyond core welfare state schemes (tax, social insurance, private/informal protection). Welfare benefits discussed in the module include, for instance, parental leave, childcare vouchers, student grants/loans, jobseeker's allowance, family income supplement, pensions and long-term care payments. Particular attention is paid to current welfare debates on �social investment�, �activation�, �new social risks� and �individualisation�.

More specifically, the emphasis is placed on the dramatic and radical changes in the relationship between war, organised violence and society over the last two centuries. The module examines the significance of war and violence as a source of social cohesion and conflict, their role in the formation of modernity and contemporary nation-states, their link with the nationalist ideologies and a number of more specific topics such as war propaganda and battlefield solidarity, war and social stratification, gendering of war, as well as the changing character of warfare and violence in the 21st century.","At the end of the module the students are expected to be able to demonstrate detail understanding of the main sociological approaches in the study of war and organised violence, the role warfare has played in the formation of modernity and the general relationships between war and society in a broader historical and geographical contexts."
201700,SOC,30390,Sociology,Punishment and Social Control,Punishment and Social Control,5,SEM_2,"For any society, the question of social control is crucial. How should societies respond to deviance and/or law-breaking? How is order to be maintained and who should have responsibility for this? What processes or institutional forms should it take? What powers and sanctions should be involved, and what outcomes should be sought? And also of course, how do these issues relate to wider debates about justice, equality, and inclusion/exclusion?

Over the course of this module, we will address these and related questions by examining, in broad terms, the nature of punishment and social control. We begin by considering how social control has developed historically and comparatively, and highlighting that law is only one of a range of methods of social control. We examine the ways in which a range of social theorists have analysed social control, particularly through the role of punishment. We then consider the development and role of different institutions in modern society, including the penal system and the police. We explore various aspect of these institutions, how they operate, and the impact they have on different sections of society. We conclude by examining a range of contemporary trends in social control and assessing their wider implications.

For some, lying is a necessary evil � judged best by what it achieves.  Others conclude that we always lie, seeing dishonesty as part of a performance that every situation requires to some extent.  Still others work tirelessly to put a price on dishonesty, seeking that threshold after which the truth is no longer worth the cost of telling it.  Finally, we have the absolutists who see lying as morally wrong regardless of outcome, context or cost.  Parents lie, using falsehoods to manipulate their children.  Children lie to avoid consequences and embarrassment.  I lie [This is the single greatest module ever taught!].  You lie.  But, why?

This module explores the social, moral and economic foundations of deception.  Rooted in sociological inquiry, we will explore life as a performance in which we play certain roles that often require us to omit, bend and outright deny beliefs, values and traits.  We will explore in detail the moral dimension of lying, considering our obligations to tell the truth and the implications of secrets.  We will highlight the role of game theory, at the core of behavioural economics, in revealing the price, cost and mechanisms of dishonesty inherent in the exchange of money and goods.  Finally, we will find the intersections, divergences and redundancies in the approaches taken by sociologists, philosophers, political scientists and economists to understand our thoroughly dishonest world.

First, it introduces the fundamentals of epidemiology (approximately 11 lectures). Epidemiology relates to the study of the distribution and determinants of outcomes in populations. As it pertains to veterinary medicine, it is most often used as a tool to study the distribution of the determinants of animal diseases. Second, given the important role of biostatistics in population sciences, its increasing prevalence in veterinary practice and its centrality to the execution and interpretation of veterinary epidemiologic research, the module also introduces bio-statistical content (approximately 5 lectures) that the graduating veterinarian should be familiar with. Finally, it introduces aspects of evidence-based veterinary medicine(approximately 6 lectures). Evidence-based veterinary medicine has been defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of animals. In large part, this evidence is drawn from a critical understanding of the published scientific literature. Students need a sound understanding of these related subjects, as they are relevant to both veterinary clinical medicine and veterinary research.
